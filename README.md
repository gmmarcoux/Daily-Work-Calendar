# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## USER STORY 
 'AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively'
 'GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist'

## Description 
This work day scheduler allows for people to see what day it is, what hour the day it is, and allows users to input text and save hourly tasks.
